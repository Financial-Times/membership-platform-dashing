<h2>Membership Programme - Team Dials</h2>
<p>
    The aim of these dials is to track the progress of achieving this year’s Membership Business Case Outcomes. The Business Case Outcomes down into components and engage contributing teams to show how the work we do is contributing towards the overall annual outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    This dial tracks the following objective taken from the Membership 2016 Business Case;
<p>
    <b>Deliver an additional 3.5k engaged B2B users (In 2016) from existing accounts through reducing login friction (SSO)</b>
</p>
<p>
    <i>This objective is a sub objective of; Deliver an additional 6000 engaged B2B users from existing accounts</i>
</p>
<p>
    This dial presents the change (+/-) in the total number of individual engaged users from ALL B2B accounts adopting CSSO, from the point when each Individual B2B account adopted (or partially adopted i.e. pilot) CSSO.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Baseline</b>
    </p>
<p>
    The baseline is ‘0’  additional 3.5k engaged B2B users - This is indicated on the graph where the RED and ORANGE sections meet.
</p>
<p>
     <b>Target</b>
     </p>
<p>
     The target is to reach an additional 3.5k engaged B2B users - This is indicated on the graph where the ORANGE and GREEN sections meet.
</p>
<p>
      <b>Source</b>
      </p>
<p>
    The RFV data is extracted from Scout
    </p>
<p>
      <b>Assumptions</b>
      </p>
<p>
    <LI>A user’s engagement is determined by their RFV Engagement score;</LI>
    <UL>Newly provisioned end users (Post Baseline/snapshot) to current established business accounts can be included as an additional engaged user.</UL>
    <LI>The most useful information to the business is the total number of Engaged Users, opposed to focussing solely on the conversion of ‘NOT engaged users’ to ’Engaged users’ from the point of the snapshot.</LI>
    <LI>The Seasonality of RFV scores are currently not reflected in the measures. (e.g. Dec/Jan is usually lower) </LI>
    <LI>The transition of users between RFV cluster groups to show increased engagement is out of scope initially but could be tracked in future releases if necessary.</LI> 
    <LI>If an account decides to cancel their adoption of CSSO - no further updates from that account will be added to the total B2B accounts dial. Any +/- changes in engaged users prior to that account’s removal of CSSO will remain in the dial counts.</LI>
